/*! Utilities for working in hexagonal space.

Inspiration for the core idea here comes from
http://keekerdc.com/2011/03/hexagon-grids-coordinate-systems-and-distance-calculations/

The root of the problem we are trying to solve here is to be able to address
positions in composites (i.e., hexagonal grids) via continuous external 2D
cartesian coordinates.

The core idea is to translate (X,Y) coordinates into 3-space. For the latter,
we use the coordinate names (A,B,C) for clarity. We constrain 3-space to the
plane `A + B + C = 0` and project it into 2-space with an orthographic position
such that each 3-space axis is at a 120Â° angle to the other two. The key here
is that this allows to align the axes with the edges of the hexagons. We thus
get something like this:

```text
*-----> +X
|   ^ +C
|    \
|     \
|      \
|       \
v        *------------> +A
+Y      / ___________      \
       / /     |     \     |
      / /      |      \    | CELL_H
     / /       |       \   |
    v /_________________\  /
   +B \        |        /
       \       |       /
        \      |      /
      |  \_____|_____/
      |
      |        \____/ CELL_CORNER
      \________/

      CELL_RADIUS
```

Every cell is indexed by an (A,B,C) coordinate where all axes are integer
multiples of `2*CELL_RADIUS`. This coordinate is the centre of the hexagon.
Since C can be trivially derived from A and B, we can store hexagons in a
two-dimensional array addressed directly by the (A,B) pair.

Transforming a 2-space point to hex-space is a simple affine transform. We
derive it here long-hand. `k` is a scaling factor we'll address later.

  Given:
  x = k * a - k/2 * (c + b)
  y = k*sqrt(3)/2 * (b - c)
  a + b + c = 0

  Work:
  b = -a - c
  x = k * a - k/2 * (c - a - c) = k * a + k/2 * a = 3*k/2 * a
  a = 2/3/k * x

  b = -2/3/k * x - c
  y = k*sqrt(3)/2 * (-2/3/k * x - 2*c)
  -2*y/k/sqrt(3) = 2/3/k * x + 2*c
  2*c = -2*y/k/sqrt(3) - 2/3/k * x
  c = -y/k/sqrt(3) - 1/3/k * x

  b = -2/3/k * x + y/k/sqrt(3) + 1/3/k * x
  b = -1/3/k * x + y/k/sqrt(3)

  Final transformation:

    | a |   | 2/3/k     0               c1 | | x |
    | b | = | -1/3/k    1/k/sqrt(3)     c2 | | y |
    | c |   | -1/3/k    -1/k/sqrt(3)    c3 | | 0 |

Three of the values in the matrix can have any arbitrary value since the Z
coordinate of the input is always 0.

We want the determinate of the transformation to be 1 so that the L2 metric in
hexagonal space equals the L2 metric of the equivalent coordinates in cartesian
space. However, we the determinate depends on c3, which is also unconstrained,
so we can't solve it this way.

Instead, go directly from the distance equations:

  Goal: sqrt(a**2 + b**2 + c**2) = sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
        a**2 + b**2 + c**2 = x**2 + y**2

  x**2 + y**2
  (k * a - k/2 * (c + b)) ** 2 + (k*sqrt(3)/2 * (b - c)) ** 2

  k**2 * ((a - 1/2*(c+b))**2 + 3/4 * (b-c)**2)
  k**2 * ((a**2 - a*(c+b) + 1/4*(c+b)**2) +
          (3/4 * b**2 - 3/2 * b * c + 3/4 * c**2))

  k**2 * (a**2 - a*b - a*c + 1/4*c**2 + 1/2*b*c + 1/4*b**2 +
          3/4 * b**2 - 3/2*b*c + 3/4*c**2)

  k**2 * (a**2 + b**2 + c**2 - a*b - a*c - b*c)
  k**2 * (a**2 + b**2 + c**2 - (a*b + a*c + b*c))

  Looking at that last group only:
  a*b + a*c + b*c
  Since a = -(b+c), b=-(a+c), c=-(a+b):
  -b*(b+c) - a*(a+b) - c*(a+c)
  -b**2 - b*c - a**2 - a*b - c**2 - a*c

  Thus
  a*b + a*c + b*c = -a**2 - b**2 - c**2 - a*b - a*c - b*c
  2*(a*b + a*c + b*c) = -a**2 - b**2 - c**2
  a*b + a*c + b*c = -1/2*a**2 -1/2*b**2 - 1/2*c**2

  Substituting back in:
  k**2 * (a**2 + b**2 + c**2 - (-1/2*a**2 -1/2*b**2 - 1/2*c**2))
  k**2 * (3/2 * a**2 + 3/2 * b**2 + 3/2 * c**2)
  k**2 * 3/2 * (a**2 + b**2 + c**2)

  So
  k**2 * 3/2 * (a**2 + b**2 + c**2) = a**2 + b**2 + c**2
  k**2 * 3/2 = 1
  k**2 = 2/3
  k = sqrt(2)/sqrt(3)

Thus the substituted transformation matrix is:
    | a | = | 2*sqrt(3)/sqrt(2)/3  0          c1 | | x |
    | b | = | -sqrt(3)/sqrt(2)/3   1/sqrt(2)  c2 | | y |
    | c | = | -sqrt(3)/sqrt(2)/3  -1/sqrt(2)  c3 | | 0 |

It would also be nice for relative angles to be preserved. We get this for free
since this is a length-preserving transformation; in order to skew angles, it
would necessarily need to compress or expand space in some cases, but we know
from above that this never happens. I.e., if we have an arbitrary triangle and
subject it to the transform, the lengths of the edges of the transformed
triangle match the original triangle, thus the new angles of the triangle must
match as well.

A common thing to do is to translate from continuous hexagonal coordinates to
the containing hexagon. How to do this is not obvious.

The coordinate system can be counter-intuitive. Particularly, the (A,B)
coordinates can actually be _less_ than the hexagon's origin; for example, as
one moves straight along positive X, the B and C coordinates become _smaller_.
It helps to first visualise the local neighbourhood of a single cell:

```text
                   ____
                  /    \
             ____/ 0-11 \____
            /    \      /    \
           / -101 \____/ 1-10 \
           \      /    \      /
            \____/ 000  \____/
            /    \      /    \
           / -110 \____/ 10-1 \
           \      /    \      /
            \____/ 01-1 \____/
                 \      /
                  \____/

```

After a bunch of drawing hexagons on paper and staring at the numbers, you
eventually find that the boundary condition for each edge is

  max(dA,dB,dC) - min(dA,dB,dC) = 1

where `dA` is the A distance from the origin of the hexagon to the point, etc.

Substituting some stuff gives us

  max(dA,dB,-(dA+dB)) - min(dA,dB,-(dA+dB)) <= 1

as the interior of the hexagon.
